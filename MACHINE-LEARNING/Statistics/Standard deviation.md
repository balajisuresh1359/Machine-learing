If the variance of daily temperatures over a week is 4.54^2 Celsius Sq., then the standard deviation would be approximately squre root of 4.54 â‰ˆ 2.13 Celsius.  
This standard deviation value indicates that, on average, the daily temperatures deviate by approximately 2.13 Celsius from the mean temperature of 21.29 Celsius.

Standard Deviation: It measures the average deviation or distance of data points from the mean value. In other words, it indicates the typical amount of deviation of individual data points from the mean. Unlike variance, standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable.
