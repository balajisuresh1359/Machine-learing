[Binomial distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binomialdistribution.asp)!

Binomial distribution summarises the number of trials, or observations, when each trial has the **same probability** of attaining one particular value.

Binomial distribution determines the probability of observing a specific number of successful outcomes in a specified number of trials.

For example, assume that a casino created a new game in which participants can place bets on the number of heads or tails in a specified number of coin flips. Assume a participant wants to place a $10 bet that there will be exactly six heads in 20 coin flips. The participant wants to calculate the probability of this occurring, and therefore, they use the calculation for binomial distribution.

The probability was calculated as (20! / (6! × (20 - 6)!)) × (0.50)(6) × (1 - 0.50)(20 - 6). Consequently, the probability of exactly six heads occurring in 20 coin flips is 0.0369, or 3.7%. The expected value was 10 heads in this case, so the participant made a poor bet.
