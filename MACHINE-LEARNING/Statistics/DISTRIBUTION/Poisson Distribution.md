The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. The events must occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.

#### **When to use?**

Use the Poisson distribution when you are counting the number of occurrences of an event within a fixed period of time, distance, area, or volume, and the events occur independently.

#### **Real-Life Problem Statement**

A call center receives an average of 10 calls per hour. You want to find the probability that the call center will receive exactly 15 calls in the next hour.


#### **Math Behind**

- λ is the average number of events per interval.
-  k is the actual number of events.

**Mean and Variance**: For the Poisson distribution, the mean (μ) and the variance (σ2) are both equal to λ.
