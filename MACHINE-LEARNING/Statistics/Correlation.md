Correlation is a statistical measure used to describe the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It quantifies how much and in what direction one variable changes when another variable changes. Correlation values range from -1 to 1:  
- A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation (both variables increase together).  
- A value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (one variable increases while the other decreases).  
- A value of 0 indicates no correlation (the variables are not related).  
  
Correlation helps identify patterns and relationships in data, but it does not imply causationâ€”just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one causes the other to change.
