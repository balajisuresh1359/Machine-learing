the variance provides a measure of how spread out the data points are around the mean, offering insights into the variability and consistency of the dataset.


Variance: It measures the average spread or dispersion of data points around their mean in a 2-dimensional space. Conceptually, you can imagine the mean as the center of a square, and the variance as the average squared distance of data points from this center. It provides a measure of the overall variability of the dataset.Standard deviation
